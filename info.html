    The first tool that I used to create is the line tool. This creates a line from one specifed point to another. When three or more line meet up on the same plane they form a face, and the line becomes an edge. This is the easiest tool to create non-regular faces with as you are not restricted to regular polygons. This tool also helps you measure out intervals on lines. If you needed to split an edge that is 150mm long into 3 50mm sections, you can measure along the line 50mm and then the tool will snap to the midpoint to split the remaining to 50mm.

    The undertray of the car is made using the line tool. This makes the the car a solid form rather than a series of faces. The wheel arches were made using triangulated faces, which creates enough clearence for the wheel. The outer edge of the arch was made using the 3 point arc tool and then triangulated along the joint. This is because SketchUp doesn't show an arc as a rounded curve. It instead shows it as line segments. This is because SketchUp doesn't use any curved forms. This is a big limitation for some, but for what the outcome I was chasing was it is sufficient for my needs.

    The push/pull tool was also a tool that I used on my model. As you can see the front corner of the bunker has been sketched onto the main face and then pulled out to where it currently sits. This tool is useful when making shapes that include uniform sizes. The downside to this tool is that if a shape requires an edge that is cut you either need to push/pull a specific sketch area on the face or create the form out of sketches and faces.

    As you can see the wheel arches and fender flares are made using the arc tool. This tool is similar to the circle tool in its execution as it creates a curved sketch on a specified plane. The circle tool uses a diameter measurement to determine its size. The circle can then be cut by another circle, an arc, a line or a specified polygon. This then splits the sketch which allows the erasion of a selected part. The arc tool works in a similar way. Using the three point arc tool you specify a starting point, then the diameter of the arc. This then specifies the plane that the arc sits on - x, y, z or a combination - then you set the bulge which completes the sketch. This tool is more useful than the circle tool as it allows you to make curves that aren't symmetrical in several planes. The arc tool allows you to make segments of circles, from 1/2 circles right down to the smallest that SketchUp will allow (I haven't reached this point before).

    The most important tool for this project was the paint bucket tool. This tool allows for faces to be painted or textured. SketchUp has a small library of both colours and textures provided but you can add more by using the custom texture creator. This creator allows you to create unprovided colours using either a RGB combinatio, hexidecimal code or a colour picker. It also allows you to import an image which can then be resized and applied to a face in the same way as a colour. I used the hexidecimal code for the Volkswagen factory colour 'Mars Red' which is the code #B22E20 and was offered for the MK1 Golf from 1979-1983. This tool allows for the model to be even more accurate and also helps to understand the contrast between the car and the plastic.

    My Inspiration for the model was this sculpture that I saw during a recent trip to Sydney. I took these photos of the sculpture that sits on the island of a roundabout. The model inspired me to make my sculpture using items that we would normally consider waste. The model is designed to visually show how cars and plastic are some of the biggest contributors to climate change. Even though they have different impacts on the climate, they are often misrepresented and grouped together. This is in fact incorrect as the manufacturers of cars are doing their part to fight against climate change, whereas the manufacturers of plastic products are making more than ever. People often say that cars are a bigger problem than plastic, but the fact is that brands have been making more efficient, and less environmentally impacting cars since the early 1970's. They have held up their end of the deal by helping to reduce their impact but the amount of plastic we use is only growing. Some has been done to counteract this, such as the banning of single use plastic bags, but not enough has been done - in my opinion.

    The custom textures that I used for my model are shown above. The first one is a swatch of 'Mars Red' as used by Volkswagen for the MK1 Golf. The second texture is recycled bottles and plastic. This is used for the crushed plastic ontop of the car. All of the other colours used in the model are default SketchUp colours.

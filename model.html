        This model depicts a Volkswagen Golf MK1 being crushed by plastic waste. This model is designed to be a draft for an art installation, but by making it in SketchUp I could take my thoughts and make them viewable to others. This creates a space for feedback and also helps to communicate size and materials. Follow the link to the 'About the Model' to read more of my inspiration and how I created the model.

        The front and rear fenders on my model are made using flat planes to make a cuvred form. This gets around a common SketchUp problem of not being able to make a 3 dimensional solid from several 2 dimensional sketches. This is a problem that has been adressed in several other CAD softwares, but I used SketchUp as I knew it was easy to embed into a HTML website. The wheels were made in Fusion 360. This is because Fusion 360 is easier to create 3 dimensional curved solids which the wheels and tyres required. I then reimported the model into SketchUp where I applied textures.

       The side of the car is flat, which it is not for an actual MK1 Golf. This is because SketchUp is not the ideal program to make a 3D form as I stated above, but no matter what free 3D modelling program you use there will be some sort of drawback. This was something that I was aware of before I started using SketchUp, but because of the ease of using the embed tool and the ability to add custom textures I decided that is was the best option.

       I left the rear of the car relatively untouched as I wanted the car itself to still be identifiable. The plastic itself sits ontop of the roof, which has been crushed in to fit. The plastic cube was made outside of the car to a approximate measurement of the interior space and then moved into position. This also helps give an idea of how much plastic would be required if the sculpture was to be commisioned.

       The model is slightly wider than the actual car as I got the measurements wrong (I realised but it was too late). The difference is about 10cm so it is still an acurate representation of the car. The interior measuremnts are almost perfect and are indistinguishable from the actual car. Overall the model is a very acurate representation of what the model could be if it was to be commisioned. You can read more about why the model was made on the 'about the model' page.
